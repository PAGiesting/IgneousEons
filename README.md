# IgneousEons
Base project, completed during Metis: Classification of igneous rocks by eon based on major and minor element chemistry.

Future:

* Dimensionality reduction.
* Clustering by both Euclidean and cosine distances on various spaces:
  * TAS
  * Other Harker plots
  * PCA components
* Come up with some commentary on the question, "What would *natural* rock classifications and rock series classifications look like?"
